<p style="text-align: center;">Hi, I am Ben one of the two developers of this Nes Metroid clone. I worked with Will Gushee, and we split up most of the tasks between us. Will worked on the enemies, sprites, audio, and refining the game. I focused on the health system, camera/screen transitions, and creating large modules for the game. In the end we were able to finish the original first level of Metroid and also make a custom level that you can access by pressing "4" while playing the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hope you will enjoy this game!</p>
